    "The objective of this exercise is to implement the function\n",
    "`split_sequences(filename, sequence_type='AA')`\n",
    "that fulfills the following requirements:\n",
    "* It tests if the file named `filename` exists.\n",
    "* The keyword argument `sequence_type` indicates whether the file contains aminoacids ('AA') or nucleic acids ('NA').\n",
    "* It reads in all sequences\n",
    "* It tests that only letters permitted for the given `sequence_type` are in the sequence.\n",
    "* It writes each sequence to a separate file named by the sequence identifier (the string after the '>' character that starts a new sequence).\n",
    "* If a file already exists, a warning is printed to screen and the file gets overwritten.\n",
    "* The function returns a dictionary. Keys = sequence ID, Value = absolute path to the file containing the sequence.\n",

    "We start where we left in the `git` exercise of Day 2.\n",
    "1. `cd` into the directory *~/Desktop/sequenceio/*. You will find two directories, _test/_ and _seqio/_.\n",
    "1. First open the test module _test/test_seqio.py_. Triple ### comments mark sections to be completed by you. \n",
    "    1. Fix all the missing parts.\n",
    "    1. From the repository root directory (_~/Desktop/sequenceio/_), run the test module:\n",

    "        pytest test/test_seqio.py\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    You should only observe test **failures** but no **errors**. \n",
    "    If you get **errors**, you need to correct the test module.\n",
    "    1. Commit your fixed test module to git.\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Now open the file _seqio/seqio.py_. Again, the triple ### comments mark the sections to be fixed. \n",
    "    1. Fix all missing parts one by one. After each change, run the test module to see if your implementation fulfills the requirements.\n",
    "    1. Git commit your work whenever one test has been fixed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Push your repository. \n",
    "1. Optional: Create a merge request targeting the master branch on mpievolbio-scicomp/sequenceio."
